# Looker Amplify Demo

The contents of this repository are a POC for using AWS Amplify as our application's back-end (integrated user management, db, api, lambda) and embed looker components for the front-end.

---

To define/do:

- do we create the users? or can they sign up themselves?
- where/when do we determine looker permissions, general user attributes, etc.?
